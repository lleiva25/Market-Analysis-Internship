About Us
We started out 2 years ago at a Hackathon in Berkeley, our team did really well
                and had sponsors approach us for creating behavioural chat bots. Over time,
                 the company split into two teams: one focusing on Large Language Models
                  and the other on quantum physics. OpenQQuantify is the result of that. We leverage AI to bridge the gaps in between
                  Electronics and the community.
                  BOTH OPEN and CLOSED SOURCE. OpenQQuantify collects comprehensive data on all aspects of the supply chain,
                  from sourcing to distribution,
                  utilizing advanced analytics and AI algorithms to optimize operations.
LLM Solution
OpenQQuantify introduces a groundbreaking solution leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for electronics design.
                Our integrated approach revolutionizes conceptualization, design,
                and validation processes in electronics development. Incorporating advanced LLMs such as GPT-4, LLaMA,
                 and Mistral for innovative design solutions.
                 A pivotal intermediary translating design concepts into actionable electronic schematics and code.
                 Simulating electronic circuits with precision and efficiency across diverse conditions and configurations.
                 LLMs evolve through feedback loops, ensuring continuous improvement and alignment with project goals.
2D Schematic Generation Solution
OpenQQuantify presents a Schematic Generation solution that leverages a large language model to automate and enhance the development of detailed 2D schematics for electronics.
                Our solution includes an advanced system for ranking and displaying components and logic based on user-defined parameters and prompts.
                The Key components are Advanced text analysis,
                Contextual understanding,
                Relevance scoring,
                Graphical output and
                Detailed report generation
3D Game Engine Simulation Solution
Utilize Nvidia Omniverse & GoDot (open-source)
                We develop game engines with physics logic for the development of
                electronics and their simulation within different environments such as
                Ideal environments,
                Space,
                Earth,
                Underwater,
                Within machinery,
                Manufacturing,
                Sustainable Material and
                Semiconductive Materials. Need a device with peripheral sensor created and simulated in real time?
                We have synthetic data generation mechanisms to simulate sensor functionality and methods for developing
                whole embedded device pipelines without having to buy the components!
                We have real-time synthetic data streams
                And batches that we offer for all types of cutting edge sensors.
